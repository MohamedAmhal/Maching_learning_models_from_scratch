## Overview

This folder contains implementations and resources related to Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. SVM is a powerful supervised learning model used for classification and regression tasks, especially effective in high-dimensional spaces.

## Folder Structure

- `svm_model.py`: Python script for implementing SVM from scratch.
- `datasets/`: Folder containing sample datasets used for training and testing the SVM model.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the folder contents and usage instructions.

## Features

- Implements Support Vector Classification (SVC).
- Supports linear and non-linear kernel functions (RBF, polynomial, etc.).
- Customizable parameters such as C (regularization) and kernel coefficients.
- Visualization of decision boundaries for 2D datasets.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
