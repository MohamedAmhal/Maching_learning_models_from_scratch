## Description

The **Model5 Decision Trees** repository provides an implementation of decision tree algorithms for classification tasks. This project aims to help users understand the mechanics of decision trees, from constructing the tree to making predictions based on the data. The implementation allows for custom features, information gain calculations, and tree splitting based on the best criteria.

## Features

- Implementation of decision tree algorithms
- Calculation of entropy and information gain
- Ability to visualize the decision tree structure
- Supports custom datasets for training and testing
- Functionality to predict classifications based on the decision tree

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   cd model5-decision-trees
