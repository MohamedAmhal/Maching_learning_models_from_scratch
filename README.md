## Introduction

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Models from Scratch** repository! This project is designed to help students and enthusiasts in the field of Big Data and Machine Learning understand how machine learning models are built from the ground up. By constructing models from scratch using Python, object-oriented programming (OOP), and essential data structures, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how these models work under the hood.

Instead of simply importing pre-built models from libraries like Scikit-learn, this repository walks you through the process of building algorithms step by stepâ€”from basic models like **Linear Regression** to more advanced techniques like **Neural Networks**.

## Why This Repo?

Many students import machine learning models from libraries without fully understanding their inner workings. This repository aims to demystify the algorithms by providing:

- **Practical coding experience** in Python.
- **In-depth explanations** of the math behind each model.
- **Implementation of fundamental data structures**.
- **OOP concepts applied** to machine learning.

## Features

- Comprehensive implementation of key machine learning algorithms.
- Step-by-step breakdown of code for every model.
- Detailed mathematical insights behind algorithms.
- Practical examples using real datasets.
- Designed for both beginners and advanced learners.

## Models Implemented

- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] Feature Scaling and Learning Rate (Linear regression)
- [x] polynomial Regression (Feature engineering)
- [x] Linear regression with scikit learn (Examples...)
- [x] Logistic Regression
