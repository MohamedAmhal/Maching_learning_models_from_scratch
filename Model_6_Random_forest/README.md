## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to obtain a more accurate and stable prediction.

### Key Features
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple decision trees to improve model accuracy and prevent overfitting.
- **Versatile**: Suitable for both classification and regression tasks.
- **Feature Importance**: Automatically ranks the importance of features used in the model, aiding in feature selection.
